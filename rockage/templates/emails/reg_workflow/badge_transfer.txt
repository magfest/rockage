{{ old.first_name }} and {{ new.first_name }},

Our records indicate that {{ old.full_name }} ({{ old.email }}) has transferred their {{ EVENT_NAME }} {{ old.badge_type_label }} registration to {{ new.full_name }} ({{ new.email }}).  So {{ old.full_name }} no longer has a paid registration, and {{ new.full_name }} should have no trouble picking up the ticket at our registration desk.
<br/><br/>
Tickets are not mailed out before the event, so your ticket will be available for pickup at the registration desk when you arrive at MAGFest. Simply bring a photo ID to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your ticket. If you ordered bonus items such as a ribbon, t-shirt, or supporter package, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth. The location and hours of the registration desk and merchandise booth will be e-mailed prior to the event.
<br/><br/>
San Jose State University students: If you transfer your discounted student ticket, the recipient must also present a valid San Jose State University student ID at our registration desk, or else they will have to pay full price at the door.
